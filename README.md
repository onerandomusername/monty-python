# Monty Python

_A Python and GitHub focused Discord bot to make collaborating on Python
projects through Discord easier than ever._

## How to use Monty

While Monty Python is open source, I'd appreciate it if you use the public
instance rather than host your own. If you're looking for something that Monty
doesn't have, consider contributing!

Invites to the public instances are below.

Monty Python#1635:
<https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=872576125384147005>\
Monty Python Beta#8789:
<https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1082552330836246528>

You can also use `/monty invite` in any server with Monty Python, which will
provide an invite.
