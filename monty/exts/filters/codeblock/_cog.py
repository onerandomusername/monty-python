    Detect improperly formatted Markdown code blocks and suggest proper formatting.

    There are four basic ways in which a code block is considered improperly formatted:

    1. The code is not within a code block at all
        * Ignored if the code is not valid Python or Python REPL code
    2. Incorrect characters are used for backticks
    3. A language for syntax highlighting is not specified
        * Ignored if the code is not valid Python or Python REPL code
    4. A syntax highlighting language is incorrectly specified
        * Ignored if the language specified doesn't look like it was meant for Python
        * This can go wrong in two ways:
            1. Spaces before the language
            2. No newline immediately following the language

    Messages or code blocks must meet a minimum line count to be detected. Detecting multiple code
    blocks is supported. However, if at least one code block is correct, then instructions will not
    be sent even if others are incorrect. When multiple incorrect code blocks are found, only the
    first one is used as the basis for the instructions sent.

    When an issue is detected, an embed is sent containing specific instructions on fixing what
    is wrong. If the user edits their message to fix the code block, the instructions will be
    removed. If they fail to fix the code block with an edit, the instructions will be updated to
    show what is still incorrect after the user's edit. The embed can be manually deleted with a
    reaction. Otherwise, it will automatically be removed after 5 minutes.

    The cog only detects messages in whitelisted channels. Channels may also have a cooldown on the
    instructions being sent. Note all help channels are also whitelisted with cooldowns enabled.

    For configurable parameters, see the `code_block` section in config-default.py.
